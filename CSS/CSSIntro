CSS takes responsibility of styling raw HTML
CSS syntax

selector{property:value}

The line below implies that you want all the paragraphs to be blue in colour
p{colour:blue;}

incase you want only a few paragraphs to be blue, you can assign classes
incase you want only a one paragraph to be blue, you can assign an Id

you can give a group of selectors too

header, p.intro{
    background-color:red;
    border-radius: 3px;
}

The above properties will be absorbed by all headers and paragraphs who belong to class intro

There are three ways to add CSS to the Markup
1)Inline CSS: CSS is added to the elements directly using style attribute
2)Internal CSS: CSS is kept separately inside the head tags in <style> tags
3)External CSS: CSS is kept separately inside a .css style sheet
